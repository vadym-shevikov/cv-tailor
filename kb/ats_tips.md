# ATS Tips & Guidelines

This document summarizes practical tips for making a CV more friendly to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

---

## 1. General ATS Principles

- ATS systems primarily parse **plain text**, not visual design.
- They look for **keywords** and phrases that match the job description.
- They often struggle with:
  - Complex two-column layouts
  - Heavy graphics
  - Text inside images
  - Very unusual section titles

**Key principle:** Favor clarity and structure over fancy design.

## 2. Formatting for ATS

- Use a simple, clean layout:
  - Single-column layout is safest.
  - Left-aligned text.
  - Standard margins and fonts.

- Use **standard section headings**:
  - `Summary` or `Professional Summary`
  - `Skills`
  - `Experience` or `Work Experience`
  - `Education`
  - `Projects` (if relevant)

- Use bullet points instead of long paragraphs for experience:
  - Each bullet should describe one key result or responsibility.

- Avoid:
  - Text boxes, tables, and multi-column templates where possible.
  - Headers and footers that contain critical information.
  - Decorative icons for skills instead of actual words.

## 3. Keyword Strategy

- Identify **role-specific keywords** in the job description, for example:
  - Technologies and tools (e.g. React, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL)
  - Methodologies (e.g. Agile, Scrum)
  - Domains (e.g. FinTech, e-commerce, healthcare)
  - Responsibilities (e.g. "lead a team", "design APIs", "optimize performance")

- Make sure these keywords appear:
  - In the **Summary** section when they truly match your profile.
  - In the **Skills** section.
  - In relevant **Experience** bullets (with real context).

- Do **not** keyword-stuff:
  - Only include skills that you actually have.
  - Avoid repeating the same keyword dozens of times.

## 4. File Name and Type

- Save your CV as a **PDF** if the employer allows it.
- Use a clear file name:
  - `Firstname_Lastname_Resume.pdf`
- Avoid special characters and very long file names.

---

## 5. Common ATS Pitfalls

- Skills only represented as logos or graphical bars.
- Job titles that are too creative and do not match standard naming.
- Missing dates or inconsistent date formats.
- Large blocks of text without bullet points.
- Critical information (like contact data) located only in the header or footer.

---

## 6. Good Practices Recap

- Use standard section titles.
- Use bullet points and clear, concise sentences.
- Mirror relevant keywords from the job description in your CV.
- Keep format simple and text-based.
- Focus on truthful, impactful content rather than decorative design.
