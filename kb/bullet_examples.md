# Example Bullet Points & Patterns

This document contains example bullet points and patterns for writing strong, impact-focused CV experience bullets.

---

## 1. General Pattern

A good bullet point often follows this pattern:

> **Action verb + what you did + how you did it + result/impact (ideally with a metric)**

Examples of strong action verbs:
- Implemented, Designed, Built, Led, Optimized, Refactored, Automated, Migrated, Integrated, Reduced, Improved, Launched, Delivered.

---

## 2. Generic Examples (Software / Product Context)

These are **generic examples** to illustrate style and structure.  
When rewriting a CV, adapt the pattern to the candidate’s actual experience.

- "Implemented server-side rendering for key pages, improving initial load speed by ~25% and raising mobile Lighthouse performance scores from 82 to 96."
- "Designed and built a reusable UI component library in React, reducing duplication and cutting new feature delivery time by ~20%."
- "Optimized database queries and caching strategy, decreasing average API response time from 800 ms to under 200 ms."
- "Led a cross-functional squad of 4 engineers and a designer to deliver a new checkout flow, increasing conversion rate by 8%."
- "Automated regression test suite using Jest and Playwright, reducing manual QA time by ~40% and catching critical issues earlier."

## 3. Domain-Specific Examples

### FinTech / Payments

- "Implemented multi-tenant payment gateway integration, supporting 5+ payment providers and handling thousands of daily transactions."
- "Improved fraud detection signals and alerting, helping reduce chargebacks by approximately 10%."
- "Collaborated with product and compliance teams to ensure new payment features met regulatory requirements (PCI-DSS, GDPR)."

### EdTech

- "Built and maintained key features for an online learning platform serving 50,000+ active users."
- "Introduced performance optimizations and lazy loading for course pages, reducing time-to-interactive by ~30%."
- "Implemented progress tracking and analytics dashboards, giving instructors better insight into learner engagement."

## 4. Refactoring Weak Bullets

Below are examples of weak vs improved bullet points:

**Weak:**
- "Worked on frontend features."

**Improved:**
- "Developed and maintained React-based frontend features, focusing on performance and accessibility for thousands of daily users."

---

**Weak:**
- "Responsible for optimizing the app."

**Improved:**
- "Optimized key user flows and assets, reducing average page load time by ~35% and improving Core Web Vitals scores."

---

**Weak:**
- "Created APIs."

**Improved:**
- "Designed and implemented REST/GraphQL APIs for user authentication and billing, enabling secure integration with 3 external services."

---

## 5. Tips When Rewriting Bullets

- Always stay **truthful**:
  - Do not add tools, responsibilities, or results that did not actually happen.
- Prefer **specific numbers** over vague statements:
  - Even approximate numbers (e.g. "~20%") are better than none.
- Align bullets with the **job description**:
  - If the job stresses performance, emphasize performance work.
  - If it stresses leadership, emphasize mentorship, ownership, decision-making.
- Remove or rewrite bullets that:
  - Are very generic.
  - Repeat the same idea without adding value.
  - Focus on tasks only, without showing impact.

## 6. Reusable Phrases (To Adapt)

These phrases can be adapted to the candidate’s actual work:

- "Improved X by ~Y% by doing Z."
- "Reduced [cost / time / errors] through [specific initiative]."
- "Collaborated with [team/role] to deliver [feature], resulting in [business outcome]."
- "Refactored legacy [module/area], improving maintainability and reducing bugs."
- "Introduced [tool/practice], which improved [process/quality] for the team."

When using these patterns in the agent, make sure the final sentence matches the real content of the CV and the job description.
