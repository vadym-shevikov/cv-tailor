# CV Best Practices (Content & Structure)

This document describes best practices for writing a strong, ATS-friendly CV.

---

## 1. Recommended Structure

A typical CV for knowledge workers (e.g. software engineers) should include:

1. **Header**
   - Name
   - Role or headline (e.g. "Senior Frontend Engineer")
   - Location (optional, city + country)
   - Contact info (email, optional phone, LinkedIn, GitHub)

2. **Summary / Professional Profile**
   - 3–5 concise sentences
   - Role, years of experience, main tech stack or skills
   - Key domains (e.g. FinTech, EdTech)
   - 1–2 signature achievements or strengths

3. **Skills / Tech Stack**
   - Grouped by categories where possible:
     - Languages & frameworks
     - Tools & platforms
     - Databases
     - Cloud / DevOps (if relevant)
   - Only list things you actually know.

4. **Experience**
   - Reverse chronological order (most recent first).
   - For each role:
     - Company, role title, location, dates.
     - 3–7 bullet points focusing on:
       - Responsibilities
       - Achievements
       - Impact and metrics

5. **Projects** (optional)
   - Highlight selected relevant personal or open source projects.

6. **Education & Certifications**
   - Degree(s) and institution(s)
   - Relevant certifications (if any)

## 2. Summary Section Guidelines

A good summary:

- Is **specific to your profile**, not generic.
- Avoids buzzword lists like “hard-working, team player, responsible”.
- Mentions:
  - Role and seniority (e.g. "Senior Frontend Engineer")
  - Years of experience (approximate is fine)
  - Main technologies
  - Key business domains or problem spaces
  - 1–2 strengths (e.g. performance optimization, product thinking)

Example patterns:

- *"Senior Frontend Engineer with 7+ years of experience building high-performance web applications in React and Next.js, primarily in FinTech and EdTech."*
- *"Focused on performance, UX, and delivering measurable business impact through clean, maintainable code."*

---

## 3. Skills Section Guidelines

- Group skills by **category**, not in one long comma-separated list.
- Prioritize skills relevant to the target role.
- Avoid outdated or irrelevant technologies unless they still matter for your target roles.
- Do not exaggerate; skill inflation is easy to detect.

Example structure:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js  
- **Backend & Databases:** Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Jest, Playwright  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

---

## 4. Experience Section Guidelines

Each role should include:

- Company, role, location (remote is ok), and dates.
- Short one-line description of the product or domain.
- Bullet points that:
  - Start with a **strong action verb** (e.g. "Implemented", "Led", "Designed", "Optimized").
  - Describe **what** you did, **how** you did it, and **what changed** as a result.
  - Mention metrics when available (e.g. performance gains, conversion rate, revenue impact).

Examples:

- "Implemented server-side rendering in Next.js, improving initial load time by ~25% and increasing mobile Lighthouse performance score from 80 to 95."
- "Led migration from a legacy frontend to a modern TypeScript + React stack, reducing bugs and support tickets by 30%."

Avoid:

- Very generic bullets like "Worked on frontend" or "Responsible for development".

---

## 5. Style & Tone

- Use **clear, direct language**.
- Avoid long, complex sentences.
- Do not use the first person ("I", "we") in bullet points.
- Keep tenses consistent:
  - Current role: present tense ("Design", "Maintain").
  - Past roles: past tense ("Designed", "Maintained").

---

## 6. Tailoring to a Specific Job

When tailoring the CV to a particular job:

- Mirror the **role title** if it matches your actual seniority and responsibilities.
- Slightly adjust the **summary** to emphasize the most relevant skills/domains.
- Reorder or adjust skills so that **job-relevant** ones appear earlier.
- Modify experience bullet points to highlight relevant achievements and tools.

---

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Overly long CV (more than 2–3 pages for most tech roles).
- Listing every tool you have ever touched.
- Using vague achievement statements without context.
- Overusing buzzwords without showing concrete impact.
- Mixing multiple languages in the same CV without clear structure.
